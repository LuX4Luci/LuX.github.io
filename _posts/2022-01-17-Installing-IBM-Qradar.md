# First Of All What is QRadar (SIEM) ?
```php
IBM QRadar SIEM (Security information and event management) is a highly scalable,
enterprise solution that consolidates log source event data from thousands of devices 
distributed across a network, storing every activity in its database, and then performing 
immediate correlation 
and application of analytics to distinguish real threats from false positives. 
QRadar SIEM deploys quickly and easily, providing contextual and actionable surveillance across the 
entire IT infrastructure,
helping organizations detect and remediate threats often missed by other security solutions.
These threats can include inappropriate use of applications; 
insider fraud and theft; and advanced, “low and slow” threats easily lost in the “noise” of
millions of events.
